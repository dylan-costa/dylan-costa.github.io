    <h2>Course Description</h2>
    <p>
      This course provides an introduction to ordinary differential equations and
      their applications. Topics include qualitative, analytical, and numerical
      methods for first- and second-order ordinary differential equations, as well
      as first-order constant-coefficient linear systems and selected nonlinear
      systems. The Laplace transform and its application to differential equations
      will also be covered.

    <h2>Summary of Graded Components</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Homework:</strong> Homework will be assigned weekly through WebAssign,
        beginning in the second week of classes. Each assignment covers material from
        the previous week. No homework will be due during exam weeks or during spring break.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>In-Class Activities:</strong> Activities will be given during the final
        15–20 minutes of class (except on exam days). Each activity will consist of
        1–2 problems completed in groups of 2–3 students. Activities are graded based
        on both completion and correctness and are intended to help assess ongoing
        understanding rather than create undue stress.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Midterm Exams and Final Exam:</strong> Three midterm exams will be given
        in class during Week 4, Week 8, and Week 12 (Thursday). The final exam will take
        place during finals week; the exact date will be announced later. Exams may
        include a combination of short-answer and multiple-choice questions, with an
        emphasis on short-answer problems. A bonus question may be included.
        <br><br>
        <strong>No notes, textbooks, calculators, phones, computers, tablets, or other
        external resources are permitted.</strong> If you are unable to attend a
        midterm exam, notify the instructor as soon as possible. Make-up exams should
        be completed within seven days of the original exam date when feasible.

    <h2>Academic Integrity Policy</h2>
    <p>
      All students are expected to act in accordance with the University of
      Connecticut Student Code. Academic misconduct includes, but is not limited to,
      cheating, plagiarism, and misrepresentation of academic work.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      “Academic misconduct is dishonest or unethical academic behavior that includes,
      but is not limited to, misrepresenting mastery in an academic area (e.g., cheating),
      failing to properly credit information, research, or ideas to their rightful
      originators or representing such information, research, or ideas as your own
      (e.g., plagiarism).”
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      You are encouraged to seek help from the instructor, peers, the Q Center, and
      other academic resources. However, all submitted work must reflect your own
      understanding. Solutions should be written entirely in your own words, and
      sources of ideas must be properly acknowledged.
    </p>

    <h2>Students with Disabilities and Special Accommodations</h2>
    <p>
      The University of Connecticut is committed to providing an accessible learning
      environment. Students who require accommodations should contact the Center for
      Students with Disabilities (Wilbur Cross Building, Room 204, (860) 486–2020 or
      <a href="https://csd.uconn.edu/">csd.uconn.edu</a>) and notify the instructor within
      the first three weeks of the semester.
    </p>

    <p>
      Student athletes and students with approved accommodations should inform the
      instructor of scheduling conflicts as early as possible.
