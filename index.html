	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<p>My name is Dylan and I am currently a PhD student at the University of Connecticut (UConn). 
	My research interest are in Number Theory. Specificially, I am currently looking into topics in Algebraic Number Theory and Arithmetic Geometry. </p>
	<p>I graduated from Ithaca College in 2021 with a BA in Mathematics with Honors and a BM in Cello Performance. During my time at Ithaca College, I participated in an REU in the summer of 2020 (oneline) and worked on 
		various projects with advising from Megan Martinez, Ted Galanthay and Emilie Wiesner. Notiably, for my senior thesis, I did a project under the advising of Ted Galanthay on different characterizations of linear
		recursive sequences.</p>
		<p>
		Outside of Mathematics, I enjoy playing cello and going to various music concerts. I play in a string quartet that puts on yearly chamber concerts during the summer in my hometown of Danbury, CT. Addtionally, I enjoy getting outside
		and playing different board games. If you want to contact me for any reason, my email is dylan.costa@uconn.edu and my office at UConn is Monteith (MONT) 413.
