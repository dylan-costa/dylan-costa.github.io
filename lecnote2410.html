      A <strong>differential equation</strong> is an equation that involves an unknown function and one or more of its derivatives.
    </div>

    <p>Throughout calculus, we have encountered many differential equations.</p>

    <div class="example">
      <span class="label">Example</span>
      \[

      \[
      \frac{dy}{dx} = x^4 + 5 \sin(x)

	<h2>Initial Value Problems</h2>

	<p>
	As we saw in the previous section, there can be infinitely many solutions to a
	differential equation. Some may be constant solutions, while others may form
	a one-parameter family of solutions. This naturally leads to the question:
	what if we want our solutions to satisfy an additional condition?
	</p>

	<div class="definition">
	  <strong>Definition.</strong>
	  An <em>initial value problem</em> (IVP) is a differential equation together with
	  one or more initial conditions that the solution must satisfy.
	</div>

	<p>
	By prescribing initial conditions, we reduce the number of possible solutions,
	often to a single solution. The solution to an initial value problem is called
	a <strong>particular solution</strong>.
	</p>

	<div class="example">
	  <strong>Example.</strong>
	  <p>
	  Verify that the family \( y = ce^x \) is a solution to
	  \[
	  y' = y
	  \]
	  on \( (-\infty, \infty) \), and find the particular solution such that
	  \( y(0) = 3 \).
	  </p>

	  <p>
	  Since \( y = ce^x \) is continuous and differentiable on
	  \( (-\infty, \infty) \), we compute
	  \[
	  y' = \frac{d}{dx}(ce^x) = ce^x = y.
	  \]
	  This verifies that \( y = ce^x \) is a one-parameter family of solutions.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	  To find the particular solution, we impose the initial condition:
	  \[
	  y(0) = ce^0 = c = 3.
	  \]
	  Hence, the particular solution is
	  \[
	  y = 3e^x.
	  \]
	  </p>
	</div>

	<hr>

	<h2>When Does an Initial Value Problem Have Solutions?</h2>

	<p>
	Given an initial value problem, it is natural to ask whether a solution exists,
	and if so, whether that solution is unique. The following theorem provides
	sufficient conditions for both existence and uniqueness.
	</p>
	
	<div class="definition">
	<span class="label">Theorem (Existence and Uniqueness)</span>

	<p>
	  Let \( R \) be a rectangle in the \( xy \)-plane containing the point
	  \( (x_0, y_0) \) in its interior. If both \( f(x,y) \) and
	  \( \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} \) are continuous on \( R \), then there exists
	  an interval \( I \) containing \( x_0 \) and a unique function \( y(x) \),
	  defined on \( I \), that solves the initial value problem
	  \[
	  \frac{dy}{dx} = f(x,y), \quad y(x_0) = y_0.
	  \]
	  </p>
	</div>



	<p>
	Let’s look at a few examples to determine whether solutions to initial value
	problems are guaranteed to exist.
	</p>

	<div class="example">
	  <strong>Example.</strong>
	  <p>
	  Consider the initial value problem
	  \[
	  \frac{dy}{dx} = xy^{1/2}.
	  \]
	  Let \( f(x,y) = xy^{1/2} \). Then
	  \[
	  \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}
	  = x\left(\frac{1}{2}y^{-1/2}\right)
	  = \frac{x}{2\sqrt{y}}.
	  \]
	  </p>

	  <p>
	  The function \( \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} \) is continuous for all
	  \( x \) and all \( y \neq 0 \). Therefore, if the initial condition satisfies
	  \( y_0 \neq 0 \), the theorem guarantees the existence of a unique solution.
	  </p>
	</div>

	<div class="remark">
	  <strong>Remark.</strong>
	  The conditions of the existence and uniqueness theorem are sufficient but not
	  necessary. An initial value problem may fail to meet these conditions and still
	  have a unique solution.
	</div>

	<hr>

	<h2>Second-Order Initial Value Problems</h2>

	<div class="example">
	  <strong>Example.</strong>
	  <p>
	  Consider the two-parameter family of functions
	  \[
	  x(t) = c_1\cos(t) + c_2\sin(t).
	  \]
	  Verify that this family satisfies the differential equation
	  \[
	  x'' + x = 0.
	  \]
	  </p>

	  <p>
	  Compute the derivatives:
	  \[
	  x' = -c_1\sin(t) + c_2\cos(t),
	  \]
	  \[
	  x'' = -c_1\cos(t) - c_2\sin(t).
	  \]
	  Substituting into the equation gives
	  \[
	  x'' + x = 0,
	  \]
	  which is an identity. Thus, this family is a solution.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	  Now find the particular solution such that
	  \[
	  x(0) = -1, \quad x'(0) = 8.
	  \]
	  From \( x(0) \),
	  \[
	  c_1 = -1.
	  \]
	  From \( x'(0) \),
	  \[
	  c_2 = 8.
	  \]
	  </p>

	  <p>
	  Therefore, the particular solution is
	  \[
	  x(t) = -\cos(t) + 8\sin(t).
	  \]
	  </p>
	</div>

	  </span>
	</h2>

	<p>
	Many real-world phenomena are best modeled using differential equations.
	This is because derivatives describe the instantaneous rate at which a quantity
	changes with respect to another variable, typically time.
	</p>

	<p>
	The goal of mathematical modeling is to translate physical assumptions into
	equations that describe how a system evolves.
	</p>

	<p>We typically construct mathematical models using the following steps:</p>

	<ol>
	  <li>Identify all variables contributing to the system.</li>
	  <li>Make reasonable assumptions to limit the number of changing variables.</li>
	  <li>Refine the model as additional data or constraints become available.</li>
	</ol>

	<p>
	There is often a balance between making a model realistic and keeping it
	mathematically tractable. Including too many variables may lead to a model
	that is difficult or impossible to analyze.
	</p>

	<p>
	A key translation used throughout this section is:
	</p>

	<p>
	\[
	\text{“rate proportional to”} \quad \Longleftrightarrow \quad k \cdot \text{(quantity)}
	\]
	</p>

	<hr>

	<div class="example">
	  <strong>Example (Radioactive Decay).</strong>

	  <p>
	  One of the most common examples of mathematical modeling using differential
	  equations is radioactive decay.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	  Let \( t \) represent time (typically measured in years), and let \( A(t) \)
	  denote the amount of radioactive substance remaining at time \( t \).
	  Then,
	  \[
	  \frac{dA}{dt}
	  \]
	  represents the rate of change of the substance.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	  A standard assumption is that the rate of decay is proportional to the amount
	  of substance remaining. This leads to the model
	  \[
	  \frac{dA}{dt} = kA, \quad k < 0.
	  \]
	  </p>

	  <p>
	  The condition \( k < 0 \) ensures that the amount of substance decreases over
	  time. Some texts instead write the model as
	  \[
	  \frac{dA}{dt} = -kA, \quad k > 0.
	  \]
	  </p>
	</div>

	<p>
	This model describes a single unstable element decaying into a stable state.
	More complex decay chains can be modeled using systems of differential equations,
	which we will study later in the course.
	</p>

	<hr>

	<div class="example">
	  <strong>Example (Spread of Disease).</strong>

	  <p>
	  Another important application of differential equations is modeling the spread
	  of disease through a population.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	  Let
	  \[
	  x(t) = \text{number of infected individuals}, \quad
	  y(t) = \text{number of uninfected individuals}.
	  \]
	  </p>

	  <p>
	  We assume that the rate at which the disease spreads is proportional to the
	  number of encounters between infected and uninfected individuals. Since the
	  number of encounters is proportional to both \( x(t) \) and \( y(t) \), we obtain
	  the model
	  \[
	  \frac{dx}{dt} = kxy.
	  \]
	  </p>

	  <p>
	  If the total population is fixed at \( n \) individuals and initially one
	  person is infected, so that \( x(0) = 1 \), then \( y = n + 1 - x \), and the
	  model becomes
	  \[
	  \frac{dx}{dt} = kx(n + 1 - x), \quad x(0) = 1.
	  \]
	  </p>
	</div>

	<p>
	This model can be further refined into a system that tracks susceptible,
	infected, and recovered populations, commonly referred to as an
	<strong>SIR model</strong>.
	</p>

	<hr>

	<div class="example">
	  <strong>Example (Draining Tank).</strong>

	  <p>
	  Suppose water leaks from a tank through a circular hole of area \( A_h \)
	  at the bottom. The volume of water leaving the tank per unit time is given by
	  \[
	  cA_h\sqrt{2gh}, \quad 0 < c < 1,
	  \]
	  where \( h \) is the height of the water and \( g \) is the acceleration due
	  to gravity.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	  Let \( V(t) \) denote the volume of water in the tank at time \( t \).
	  Then
	  \[
	  \frac{dV}{dt} = cA_h\sqrt{2gh}.
	  \]
	  </p>

	  <p>
	  Suppose the tank is cubical and has base area \( A_w \). Since volume is related
	  to height by
	  \[
	  V(t) = A_wh,
	  \]
	  implicit differentiation gives
	  \[
	  \frac{dV}{dt} = A_w\frac{dh}{dt}.
	  \]
	  </p>

	  <p>
	  Substituting into the expression for \( \frac{dV}{dt} \), we obtain the model
	  \[
	  \frac{dh}{dt} = \frac{1}{A_w} cA_h\sqrt{2gh}.
	  \]

	A first-order differential equation of the form

	\[

	  </span>
	</h2>
	
	<p>
	So far, the only method for finding solutions to differential equations we have is
	<strong>separation of variables</strong>. This works when the first-order differential
	equation is of the form
	</p>

	\[
	\frac{dy}{dx} = g(x)h(y).
	\]

	<p>
	However, in general, most first-order differential equations will not be separable.
	Thus, we need a method that works for more first-order differential equations.
	</p>

	<p>
	Consider a first-order linear differential equation
	</p>

	\[
	y' + a_0(x)y = g(x).
	\]

	<p>
	This is known as <strong>standard form</strong>. Note that even if the coefficient in
	front of \(y'\) is not 1, we can always divide the equation by any nonzero function
	and put the differential equation in standard form.
	</p>

	<hr>

	<div class="definition">
	<span class="label">Definition</span>

	<p>
	A first-order linear differential equation in standard form is
	</p>

	\[
	y' + P(x)y = f(x).
	\]

	<p>
	The method used to solve all first-order linear differential equations is known as
	the <strong>method of integrating factor</strong>.
	</p>

	</div>

	<p>
	Multiply both sides of the equation by some function \(\mu(x)\):
	</p>

	\[
	\mu(x)(y' + P(x)y) = \mu(x)y' + \mu(x)P(x)y = \mu(x)f(x).
	\]

	<p>
	Recall the product rule:
	</p>

	\[
	\frac{d}{dx}(\mu(x)y) = \mu(x)y' + \mu'(x)y.
	\]

	<p>
	These expressions are equal if
	</p>

	\[
	\mu'(x) = \mu(x)P(x).
	\]

	<p>
	This is a separable differential equation:
	</p>

	\[
	\frac{d\mu}{dx} = \mu(x)P(x).
	\]

	<p>
	Using separation of variables:
	</p>

	\[
	\frac{d\mu}{\mu} = P(x)\,dx.
	\]

	\[
	\int \frac{d\mu}{\mu} = \int P(x)\,dx.
	\]

	\[
	\ln|\mu| = \int P(x)\,dx.
	\]

	\[
	\mu(x) = e^{\int P(x)\,dx}.
	\]

	<div class="definition">
	<span class="label">Integrating Factor</span>

	\[
	\mu(x) = e^{\int P(x)\,dx}.
	\]

	</div>

	<p>
	With this choice of \(\mu(x)\), we obtain
	</p>

	\[
	\frac{d}{dx}(\mu(x)y) = \mu(x)f(x).
	\]

	<p>
	Integrating both sides:
	</p>

	\[
	y = \frac{1}{\mu(x)}\int \mu(x)f(x)\,dx
	= e^{-\int P(x)\,dx}\int e^{\int P(x)\,dx} f(x)\,dx.

	A differential \(M(x,y)\,dx + N(x,y)\,dy\) is exact if and only if
