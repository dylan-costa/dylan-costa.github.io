    <div class="definition">
      <span class="label">Definition</span>
      A <strong>differential equation</strong> is an equation that involves an unknown function and one or more of its derivatives.
    </div>

    <p>Throughout calculus, we have encountered many differential equations.</p>

    <div class="example">
      <span class="label">Example</span>
      \[
      \frac{dy}{dx} = 3x^2
      \]
      \[
      \frac{dy}{dx} = x^4 + 5 \sin(x)
      \]
      These are differential equations since they involve the derivative of the unknown function $y(x)$.
    </div>

    <div class="example">
      <span class="label">Example</span>
      \[
      y'' + 4y = 0
      \]
      This is a second-order differential equation.
    </div>

    <h3>Classification by Type</h3>
    <div class="definition">
      <span class="label">Definition</span>
      An <strong>ordinary differential equation (ODE)</strong> contains only ordinary derivatives of one or more unknown functions.
    </div>

    <div class="definition">
      <span class="label">Definition</span>
      A <strong>partial differential equation (PDE)</strong> involves partial derivatives of unknown functions of two or more variables.

    <h3>Classification by Order</h3>
    <div class="definition">
      <span class="label">Definition</span>
      The <strong>order</strong> of a differential equation is the highest derivative that appears.
    </div>

    <h3>Classification by Linearity</h3>
    <div class="definition">
      <span class="label">Definition</span>
      A differential equation is <strong>linear</strong> if it can be written as:
      \[
      a_n(x)y^{(n)} + a_{n-1}(x)y^{(n-1)} + \dots + a_1(x)y' + a_0(x)y = g(x)
      \]
      where the coefficients depend only on $x$.

	<div class="definition">
	  <strong>Definition.</strong>
	  A solution to a differential equation written in the form
	  \( y = \phi(x) \) is called an <em>explicit</em> solution.
	  A solution written in the form \( G(x,y) = 0 \) is called an
	  <em>implicit</em> solution.

	Often, implicit solutions are sufficient to describe the behavior of solutions,
	especially when solving explicitly is difficult or unnecessary.

	<h3 id="families">Families of Solutions</h3>

	Differential equations often admit infinitely many solutions that differ by

	<h1>Lecture 2: Section 1.2 — Initial Value Problems</h1>
	<hr>

	<h2>Initial Value Problems</h2>

	<p>
	As we saw in the previous section, there can be infinitely many solutions to a
	differential equation. Some may be constant solutions, while others may form
	a one-parameter family of solutions. This naturally leads to the question:
	what if we want our solutions to satisfy an additional condition?
	</p>

	<div class="definition">
	  <strong>Definition.</strong>
	  An <em>initial value problem</em> (IVP) is a differential equation together with
	  one or more initial conditions that the solution must satisfy.
	</div>

	<p>
	By prescribing initial conditions, we reduce the number of possible solutions,
	often to a single solution. The solution to an initial value problem is called
	a <strong>particular solution</strong>.
	</p>

	<div class="example">
	  <strong>Example.</strong>
	  <p>
	  Verify that the family \( y = ce^x \) is a solution to
	  \[
	  y' = y
	  \]
	  on \( (-\infty, \infty) \), and find the particular solution such that
	  \( y(0) = 3 \).
	  </p>

	  <p>
	  Since \( y = ce^x \) is continuous and differentiable on
	  \( (-\infty, \infty) \), we compute
	  \[
	  y' = \frac{d}{dx}(ce^x) = ce^x = y.
	  \]
	  This verifies that \( y = ce^x \) is a one-parameter family of solutions.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	  To find the particular solution, we impose the initial condition:
	  \[
	  y(0) = ce^0 = c = 3.
	  \]
	  Hence, the particular solution is
	  \[
	  y = 3e^x.
	  \]
	  </p>
	</div>

	<hr>

	<h2>When Does an Initial Value Problem Have Solutions?</h2>

	<p>
	Given an initial value problem, it is natural to ask whether a solution exists,
	and if so, whether that solution is unique. The following theorem provides
	sufficient conditions for both existence and uniqueness.
	</p>

	<div class="theorem">
	  <strong>Theorem (Existence and Uniqueness).</strong>
	  <p>
	  Let \( R \) be a rectangle in the \( xy \)-plane containing the point
	  \( (x_0, y_0) \) in its interior. If both \( f(x,y) \) and
	  \( \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} \) are continuous on \( R \), then there exists
	  an interval \( I \) containing \( x_0 \) and a unique function \( y(x) \),
	  defined on \( I \), that solves the initial value problem
	  \[
	  \frac{dy}{dx} = f(x,y), \quad y(x_0) = y_0.
	  \]
	  </p>
	</div>

	<p>
	Let’s look at a few examples to determine whether solutions to initial value
	problems are guaranteed to exist.
	</p>

	<div class="example">
	  <strong>Example.</strong>
	  <p>
	  Consider the initial value problem
	  \[
	  \frac{dy}{dx} = xy^{1/2}.
	  \]
	  Let \( f(x,y) = xy^{1/2} \). Then
	  \[
	  \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}
	  = x\left(\frac{1}{2}y^{-1/2}\right)
	  = \frac{x}{2\sqrt{y}}.
	  \]
	  </p>

	  <p>
	  The function \( \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} \) is continuous for all
	  \( x \) and all \( y \neq 0 \). Therefore, if the initial condition satisfies
	  \( y_0 \neq 0 \), the theorem guarantees the existence of a unique solution.
	  </p>
	</div>

	<div class="remark">
	  <strong>Remark.</strong>
	  The conditions of the existence and uniqueness theorem are sufficient but not
	  necessary. An initial value problem may fail to meet these conditions and still
	  have a unique solution.
	</div>

	<hr>

	<h2>Second-Order Initial Value Problems</h2>

	<div class="example">
	  <strong>Example.</strong>
	  <p>
	  Consider the two-parameter family of functions
	  \[
	  x(t) = c_1\cos(t) + c_2\sin(t).
	  \]
	  Verify that this family satisfies the differential equation
	  \[
	  x'' + x = 0.
	  \]
	  </p>

	  <p>
	  Compute the derivatives:
	  \[
	  x' = -c_1\sin(t) + c_2\cos(t),
	  \]
	  \[
	  x'' = -c_1\cos(t) - c_2\sin(t).
	  \]
	  Substituting into the equation gives
	  \[
	  x'' + x = 0,
	  \]
	  which is an identity. Thus, this family is a solution.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	  Now find the particular solution such that
	  \[
	  x(0) = -1, \quad x'(0) = 8.
	  \]
	  From \( x(0) \),
	  \[
	  c_1 = -1.
	  \]
	  From \( x'(0) \),
	  \[
	  c_2 = 8.
	  \]
	  </p>

	  <p>
	  Therefore, the particular solution is
	  \[
	  x(t) = -\cos(t) + 8\sin(t).
	  \]
	  </p>
	</div>
